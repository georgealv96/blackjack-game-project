# Single-deck Blackjack

## One of the most popular casino games out there!

This project is your classic blackjack game but one deck at a time. I was inspired by my most favorite and 
the nearest gambling town that I have from home (West Wendover, NV) to create this single-deck version.
Also, I'm a blackjack fanatic! so I couldn't skip this opportunity to make one myself for my very first project of this type (a web-based game).

## Rules to the game:

Basically, all you are trying to do is beat the dealer.

### The ways to beat the dealer are:

—By drawing a hand value that is higher than the dealer’s hand value. </br>
—By the dealer drawing a hand value that goes over 21. </br>
—By drawing a hand value of 21 on your first two cards, when the dealer does not. <br>

### The ways to lose to the dealer are: 

—Your hand value exceeds 21 (or "busting"). </br>
—The dealers hand has a greater value than yours at the end of the round. </br>

## My experience building this project

Even though a lot of the making of this game was fun to me —especially because of how much I enjoy 
casino-related stuff, blackjack, math and coding—, I encountered a few problems, challenges and frustrations.

### Some of the biggest challenges were:

—Connecting the start with the end of the game. </br>
—The logic of Aces. </br>
—How to keep the wagering system decently consistent throghout the entire time an user
is playing regardless of the amount of rounds played.

I'm working on making this entire game as accurate as possible so the user can have the best experience and most fun possible!
