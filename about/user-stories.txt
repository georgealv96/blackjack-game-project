// Once the website initializes:

  // As an user, I would like to see the amount of dollars I'm starting with.

  // As an user, I would like to be able to select the amount of money I want to bet.

  // As an user, I would like to see a button to place the bets, so that the game gets started.

// Once the game starts:

  // As an user, I'd like to be able to see one card for the dealer and two cards for the player facing up.

  // As an user, I'd like to see how much money I have available, and also the sum of the player's cards.

  // As an user, I'd like to be able to select one of the following options:
     hit, stand, surrender (if possible) or double-down (if possible).

  // If the player hits:

    // As an user, I'd like to see an extra card on the player's hand and the sum of all of
       the player's cards.

    // As an user, I'd like to be able to select one of the following options:
       hit or stand.

  // If the player stands:
  
    // As an user, I'd like to see the dealer's second card value and the sum of all of its cards, 
       the sum of the player's cards as well.

  // Once the round is over:
  
    // As an user, I'd like to see a window that says who's the winner; if the player wins, I'd like to see the amount of dollars they got from that last round.

    // As an user, I'd like to see a button that says "PLAY AGAIN."
